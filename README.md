## About

The website that lets you dance to In My Feelings, the viral song by Drake, and copy DrAIke with the help of PoseNet.

As you can guess, the name “DrAIke” is the compound word of Drake and AI. DrAIke refers to both this webiste and the master dancer in this game. Depending on how well you you copy DrAIke, you can earn the score and watch fun videos made by PoseNet. This project utilizes TensorFlow.js, the popular deep learning framework that runs on browers, and PoseNet, the project that detects the poses through computer vision. Both are developed by Google. (I love you Google!) . 

We began this project when we got inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prswDGGmYaE) of [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A/featured), the well-known Youtuber who ambitiously educate deep learning to people. He also provided us helpful feedbacks, and we could improve our website. Here is his PoseNet code: https://github.com/llSourcell/InMyFeelings_Challenge

We will keep adding the documents here and improve our website.  
Actually, we are highschoolers, and this is our first web project. So there can be many stupid codes. If you want to improve them, please let us know on "issues".


## For those of you who want to know more about PoseNet

You can also play the demo provided by Google. [Try it here!](https://montrealai.github.io/posenet-v3/)

PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.

[This](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) is a Pure Javascript implementation of PoseNet.

[Refer to this blog post](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5) for a high-level description of PoseNet running on Tensorflow.js.
